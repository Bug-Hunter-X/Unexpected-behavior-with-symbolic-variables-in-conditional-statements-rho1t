This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in MATLAB related to the use of symbolic variables within conditional statements. The function `myFunction.m` is designed to perform a conditional calculation based on the input value `x`. When `x` is a numerical value, the function works as expected. However, when `x` is a symbolic variable, the conditional statement yields unexpected results due to the way MATLAB handles symbolic comparisons.  The solution `myFunctionSolution.m` provides a corrected version of the function that handles both numeric and symbolic inputs gracefully.
